LUX is designed to be a creative, open source, collaborative network that puts Directors, Actors, Cinematographers, Writers, Editors, Visual Effects Designers, Musicians, Sound Designers, and all around creatives alike underneath one roof. By doing this it serves to create a community of artists that can collaborate on each other's projects. The club also features work, organizes festival deadlines, and connects to other schools to broaden it's networking abilities. To individuals who are new to the art of video production, LUX is also a learning platform where more experienced individuals have an opportunity to showcase what they have learned and even give keynotes on particular topics within film. LUX is a dynamic video platform that will evolve and expand.","luxvideo@uw.edu","PERFORMING","https://uws-community.symplicity.com/files/c1b/c1b2eb6319083acb54434a615aae6bd9.png","https://www.facebook.com/uwluxvideo/"

In association with the national organization, Active Minds, we strive to promote mental health awareness and education through campaigns, fundraising, informational meetings, and community-wide events. Examples of such campaigns and events include: Stress Less Week, Suicide Prevention Month, National Eating Disorders Awareness Week, etc.. Mental health disorders are an ever-growing problem in college. Unfortunately, most students suffer silently for fear of what others may think, or they simply don’t know where to start in getting help. It can be horribly isolating. Our goal is to provide a place where students can learn about mental health, and mental health issues. We hope to provide information about resources both on and off campus in order to promote help-seeking behaviors in individuals who may be able to benefit from them. We also work to relay the latest scholarly findings of mental health research and information as it pertains to college students. Mental health affects everyone in one way or another, which is why we need to bring Active Mind to UW. All students are welcome and encouraged to join. Please be sure to keep in mind that this is NOT a support group, and we do not provide any mental health counseling of any kind. We are not mental health professionals, but rather students interested in spreading mental health information and awareness, in order to stand up against the stigma surrounding mental health problems, and to promote a mentally healthy campus. Students with or without mental health issues are equally encouraged to join.

Beyond the Bomb is a bold new step towards a world free of the nuclear system’s yoke. Through grassroots organizing all over the U.S., we will build a wave of opposition to nuclear weapons and the networks of money and power that prop them up. Our movement will move from the local level to the state level to the federal level, building a base of engaged activists and supporters to change the conversation around nuclear weapons in this country. We are embracing the intersectionality of our issue, basing our organization on the knowledge that it’s the most marginalized of communities that are affected most by the nuclear system. Basing our organizing and actions around the voices of those communities and lifting up their stories, we will reveal the true fruits of the corrupt nuclear status quo.

2) Preparation: One of our club’s most valuable resources is providing members the opportunity to prepare and practice for case interviews. Almost all consulting firms and many other organizations use case interviews as an evaluative measure of how well applicants can think about business problems. We also provide members with training in how to be a successful consultant after they land an internship or full-time job.

determination for the pursuit of ultimate truth of mind, technique, and body. Thus, it shall be the purpose of this organization to teach Karate, in accordance with the guidelines provided by the International Karate Organization (IKO) Kyokushinkaikan, not only as a form of unarmed combat but as a way to discipline the body in order to improve the spirit.
This organization shall follow the Karate way of building character, and training the mind and body to contribute to society, based on Sosai Mas Oyama's Kyokushin spirit—“Keep your head low (modesty), eyes high (ambition), mouth shut (serenity); base yourself on filial piety and benefit others.” Kyokushin Karate has been known as “The strongest karate,” not only because of the incredible feats of strength and endurance that Founder Masutatsu Oyama performed, but also because of the rigorous requirements of the training and tournaments. By practicing Karate, one can increase his/her alertness, self-awareness and selfconfidence by conditioning the body as improving speed, strength, and coordination.It is to achieve the unity of body and spirit.
We in Kyokushin Karate-Do do not promote or practice discrimination or prejudice based on ethnicity, race, nationality, politics, philosophy, religion, sex or age and recognize that everyone has the same rights. Our greatest pursuit is to contribute to society through the wisdom of Kyokushin Karate-Do, and to reach for the goal of international friendship and World Peace.","kkwa@uw.edu","SPORTS","https://uws-community.symplicity.com/files/040/040ae586cf26ee9c8e01b795ed801197.jpg","https://www.facebook.com/KyokushinKarateNY/"

We are engaged in providing effective outreach to students about the benefits of smart solar investments.
UW-Solar has two objectives:
1. To provide clean and sustainable power production in order to reduce reliance on outside energy resources, improve the resilience of power systems to outages and reduce the overall  carbon footprint of the university. Allowing the university to become more self-sufficient in its energy production will reduce direct costs and environmental impact while improving capabilities for community service and rapid recovery during any future crises. The use of clean and renewable energy sources are a primary objective, as stated in the University of 
Washington Climate Action plan, for the future sustainability of the University.
2. Smart infrastructure systems rely upon computerized systems (SCADA) for monitoring and remote control. SCADA systems control water and sewer infrastructure, electrical grids, oil refineries, transportation systems, manufacturing systems, nuclear energy and hazardous chemical production. Historically, such systems were developed in isolation from each other, and were not designed for security and resilience to cyber-attack. The security of these systems on campus is important to UW, and as a model for other campuses, but also cities and regions. This project creates an opportunity for students to lead a project that develops and studies smart solar energy Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.","solaruw@uw.edu","SPECIAL INTEREST","https://uws-community.symplicity.com/files/789/78997762687a5daccedbd97b53242185.jpg","https://www.facebook.com/UW-Solar-251198231673083/likes"
